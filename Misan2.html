                  <h2>By the way, do you know how the <b>internet</b> works?</h2> 
                       <p>Well, from my perspective, the internet is just the communication between a web browser and a server.The browser requests for information,while the server responds(with an html file i think)</p>
                       <p>As they communicate, Hyper text transfer protocol secure(HTTPS), ensures that what ever information being transfered is encrypted.Making it hard for intruders to snoop around i guess</p>
                       <p>Also, every website has an internet protocol address(IP).This address can be found in a domain naming system(DNS),which is like a dictionary for IP addresses </p>
